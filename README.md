# Access to electricity Analysis (1960-2022)

## Overview  
This project explores global **electricity access trends** from **1960 to 2022**, focusing on key aspects such as:  
- **Disparities in electricity access** between rural and urban areas.  
- **The relationship between electricity access and GDP per capita.**  
- **The relationship between electricity access and energy imports.**  

Using interactive visualizations and data-driven analysis, the project aims to provide valuable insights into **global electrification progress and its influencing factors**.

## Data Sources  
The dataset includes electricity access statistics, GDP per capita, and energy imports, sourced from:
- **The World Bank Open Data** (https://databank.worldbank.org/source/world-development-indicators/)


---

All data has been **cleaned, structured, and processed** for accurate analysis.
### **Preprocessing**
1. **Handling Missing Values** 
   - Null values (`"null", "NA", "NaN", "", ".."`) are replaced with `None` for consistency.  
2. **Reshaping the Data** ðŸ”„  
   - The dataset is **unpivoted** (long format) to make each year a separate row.  
   - It is then **pivoted back** to a wide format where each indicator becomes a column.  
3. **Renaming Columns for Clarity** 
   - Key variables are renamed:
     - `"Access to electricity (% of population)"` â†’ `total_rate`
     - `"Access to electricity, rural (% of rural population)"` â†’ `rural_rate`
     - `"Access to electricity, urban (% of urban population)"` â†’ `urban_rate`
     - `"GDP per capita (constant 2015 US$)"` â†’ `GDP`
     - `"Energy imports, net (% of energy use)"` â†’ `energy_imports`
4. **Year Formatting**
   - The **year column is cleaned** to keep only the first four digits.  
5. **Mapping Countries to Continents**
   - Countries are mapped to continents using the **`pycountry` and `pycountry_convert`** libraries.  
   - **Special cases** (e.g., Kosovo, Timor-Leste) are manually assigned to the correct continent.  
   - **Asia & Oceania** are grouped into a **single "Asia/Oceania" category** for better analysis.

## Key Research Questions  
This project investigates:
1. **How has access to electricity evolved globally from 1960 to 2022?**  
2. **What are the disparities between rural and urban electricity access?**  
3. **Is there a strong correlation between electricity access and GDP per capita?**  
4. **Does reliance on energy imports impact electricity access?**  
5. **Which regions have made the most progress in electrification?**
